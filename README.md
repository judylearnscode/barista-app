I worked with a team of developers to create a boba ordering app. The cashier opens the webpage and submits a customer's order. A barista is able to log in to see all of the pending orders. When the order is completed, it moves into the "completed orders" list and the customer's name is called out to indicate their order is ready. 

Languages used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node

Lessons Learned:

It was a bit tricky to figure out how to CSS each individual page with EJS. I learned how important classes are in targeting specific elements.
